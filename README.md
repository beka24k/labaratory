# **Description**
Welcome aboard, fellow developer. This is where you can find interesting methods (used *Laboratory 1* from the best senior lecturer) using recursion and functions which you are free to use
## **Recursion and Functions in Java**
Recursion is the technique of making a function call itself. This technique provides a way to break complicated problems down into simple problems which are easier to solve.

Recursion may be a bit difficult to understand. The best way to figure out how it works is to experiment with it.
## Recursive Functions
The following are examples of recursive functions included in this repository:

__factorial(n)__ - computes the factorial of a given integer using recursion.

__fibonacci(n)__ - computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence using recursion.

__binomial coefficient(n,k)__ - is the order of choosing ‘k’ results from the given ‘n’ possibilities.
